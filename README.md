# Exercise 1: Bitmap Data Structure in C

The instructions for this assignment are here: [http://faculty.cs.gwu.edu/~timwood/wiki/doku.php/teaching:f2016:cs2113:ex1](http://faculty.cs.gwu.edu/~timwood/wiki/doku.php/teaching:f2016:cs2113:ex1)

Phase 0 and Phase 1 are due Tuesday September 6th at 11:59PM.

## Compiling and Running Your Code
As noted in the instructions, this code requires the C math library to compile. To build and run your code use:

```
  gcc -lm bitmap.c -o bits
  ./bits
```

## Submitting Your Code
To submit your code you will need to...

Step 0. Make sure you are in the right directory with your code. If you run `ls` you should see output like:

```
  cabox@box-codeanywhere:~/workspace/ex-1-bitmap$ ls
  README.md bitmap.c  bits
```

Step 1. Add and commit your files locally:

```
  git add bitmap.c
  git commit -m "Working step 1"
```
Step 2. Push those files to your github repository:

```
  git push origin master
```
Step 3. Verify that your code is updated by finding your repository on the github web interface and looking at the files.
